Codebook for the Course Project on
Activity Data gathered from
Accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

Data Set Summary
================

From the Original codebook of the datasets utilized for this project:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For the current dataset generated by this project:
The mean and standard deviation related columns from the test and train datasets were combined and data was aggregated for each subject by the activity type. Multiple steps were executed to arrive at a single tidy dataset with the average values.

Source DataSets Used
====================
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Train subjects.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Test subjects.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Final DataSet
==============

- 'Tidyfile.txt': Average values of the variable captured in the original datasets by subject and activity label.

Variables in integer format
===========================
1 Subject : identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
2 ActivityNbr: Activity label. Refer to 'activity_labels.txt' from the Source codebook for descriptions of each label
